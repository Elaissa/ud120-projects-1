ud120-projects
==============

This repo consists of: 

1. Mini-projects I completed for the Udacity's [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/courses/ud120).  
2. Final project analyzing Enron financial and email data for fraud.

My blog contains a post with lesson notes and a cheatsheet of the scikit-learn functions used throughout the course.
